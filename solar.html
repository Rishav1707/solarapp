            <h1>Abob Tech solar calculator.</h1>
            <p>This solar installation requirements calculator was compiled using standard factors like, 80% efficiency, 1.25 correction factor, 5hrs peak sunlight, 50% DOD, and 0.8 PF for optimal performance and efficiency.</p>
            <p>The calculator helps you calculate and output the requirements you will need like, solar panel, battery bank size, charge controller, and inverter needed to set up a solar system for your appliances per hour after sunset.</p>
            <p>It only requires you to input your appliance load (w) and the number of hours(hrs) you'd want to use your solar backup after sunset (when the battery stops charging).</p>
            <p><span class="bolded">1</span>. How to get the load of the appliance per watt: 
            Look at the back, top, or power pack of your appliance, record the number with the wattage (W) sign of the appliance you'd want to use, and then sum them up.
            eg. Laptop 90w, TV 45w, 2 phone chargers 2 x 5w =10w, decoder 40w; 
            90 + 45 + 10 + 40 = 185w. So the load of my appliances = 185w.
            </p>
            <p><span class="bolded">2</span>. How many hours do you want to use the appliances after sunset? e.g 5hrs  </p>
            <p>Write out the total appliance loads and hrs.</p>
            <p>Input your values into the solar system requirements calculator and click show requirements.</p>
